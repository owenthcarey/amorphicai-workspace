# AmorphicAI

AmorphicAI is a cutting-edge dating app that revolutionizes the way you find matches. Our app intelligently learns your preferences by having you swipe through a thousand profiles and then creating a personalized yes-no image classifier using TensorFlow.js. This project is built with Nx and xplat for seamless code sharing between Angular web and Angular NativeScript platforms.
